# sql-challenge

There are six (6) csv files in the /data directory, each file coresponding to a table in the ERD with the same name.

The ERD is in the /employees_sql directory as an image file, which was created with QuickDBD and exported as a png.

The /employees_sql directory also contains two SQL source files.  File schema.sql has all the table creations for the data files.  File queries.sql has all the queries from the challenge as given in the instructions.
